        <h1>Why Coding?</h1>
        <p>
            I was drawn to coding for its structure and rules, oddly enough. As an autistic adult who only recently discovered that diagnosis, I've spent a large part of my life trying to intepret and understand the world around me without the proper tools needed to do so. It can be maddening living in a world that is as filled with hidden meanings, nonverbal language, societal expecations, and social cues that my brain doesn't inherently pick up on.

            That type of thing just doesn't exist with computers and coding. Not in the same way. There are rules, and guidelines, and structures to how these things work. If my program isn't working the way I would expect it to or I'm misunderstanding my output, it's because I've made a mistake in my code somewhere. There is no "well that's not how they <em>meant</em> to say it, that's just how you took it" with coding. There are no false pretenses or hidden expectations. The system works. You just have to learn it.
