        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
        I have many different hobbies, but the two biggest ones that I'll share with you are Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), and Magic: The Gathering (M:TG).</p>
            <br>
        <p>I first fell in love with D&D in 2015 after a work friend invited me and another coworker into this game. I developed a slow burn love affair with D&D. I was a big fan of the gamelplay, but I didn't realise that what I was truly missing was the excitment, thrill, and creativity offered in being a "Dungeon Master". Telling a story with my friends that we're all invested in with out various characters has been an experience like no other. If you've ever had even the slightest notion of "Hey, that sounds neat and I think I might like it", then I encourage you to follow the links below and learn a little bit more about it. I can't recommend the game enough to anyone looking for an outlet for creativity.</p>
            <br>
        <p>It was another year before my brother informed me that he had been playing a card game called Magic: The Gathering with his work friends, and that he thought I might like it. That relationship was a very quick progression for me. I soon found myself consumed by the interactions and layers of rules and the "how" of playing the game. With it's "Color Pie" mechanic, I truly believe it to be the greatest card game that has ever been developed. Don't believe me? Follow the link to M:TG Arena below and give it a shot. It's free to download and you can start playing today.</p>
